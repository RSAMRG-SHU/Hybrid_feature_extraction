# Hybrid_feature_extraction
LCSD dataset and a vailable lightweight network
This is an algorithm for extracting multi-primitive (including corner, lines, and planes) features from architectural scenarios point clouds, and a classification algorithm for local curvature spatial descriptors (LCSD) constructed from voxels. It includes pre-trained networks, constructed training sample data and matlab code.
The specific algorithm principles and usage methods will be made public after the relevant paper is accepted.
